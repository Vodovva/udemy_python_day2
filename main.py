# Lesson 1
# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
# Warning. Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.
# The last line of your program should print the result.
# Example 1 Input
# 39
# Example 1 Output
# 12

# two_digit_number = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
####################################
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# print(type(two_digit_number))
# first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
# second_digit = int(two_digit_number [1])
# two_digit_number = first_digit + second_digit
# print(two_digit_number)



# 3 + 5 addition
# 7 - 3 subtraction
# 3 * 2 multiple
# print(type(6 / 3)) division
#  5 ** 6,  5 to the power of 6, 5*5*5*5*5*5
# P E M D A S
# ()
# **
# * /
# + -

print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3) 
#  = 7 (3*3) + (3/3) - 3 = 7
#  to get the number 3
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)



# Lesson 2
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# BMI Wikipedia Page

# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):


# NOTE: You should convert the bmi to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See examples below.

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
# height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
# weight = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# weight_as_int = int(weight)
# height_as_float = float(height)
# bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# # or
# bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)
# bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
# print(bmi_as_int)
